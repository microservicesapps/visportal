### How much does it cost to build an app like Visportal

It is a task to analyze the [cost of
development](https://www.engineerbabu.com/blog/mobile-application-cost/) of a
mobile app like Visportal. The entire design of the app is split into several parts
based on the specifications required. The cost of development of a popular app
like Visportal depends on the following factors:

**The size of the team **If the team is small and functional, the process can go
smooth. Let’s say, the project manager handling more than his part. Else, other
than a designer and developer, a lot more people like project manager, system
administrator, quality assurance member will be required in the team.

**The number of platforms the app is being built for **The cost of building an
app like Visportal fluctuates based on different platforms. iOS, Android both need
different app screens to adjust the app too. All this is decided based on the
target audience, device environment, etc. Moreover, android app development
takes a little more time than iOS as it has more devices to be tested against.

**Features and Functionality of the app **Another important factor in
development is the features and functionalities one wishes to incorporate. Basic
features like past booking history, reviews, and ratings, data of the hosts,
communication between the host and traveler, etc. occupy a lot of space and
result in a surplus charge.

**Design of the app **Visportal being a big app, has to look good to attract the
customers all around the global market. It should leave a long lasting
impression on the mind of the viewer to lure them into making reservations. The
app should be easy to use and the design has to be engaging. Another aspect os
the design is whether its standard or customized. New, unique visuals can be
added instead of the stereotype backdrop. New designs will definitely shoot the
development price.

**Developers **The most vital point is, where are you looking for the
developers. The place or location of the developer is one of the deciding
factor. Also, the cost will vary based on the experience of the developer and
his/her expertise.

**In-app purchases and any other special features. **Any technical complexity
that you desire to add, be it simple, medium or high, will affect the costing.
Different features like geolocation, data sync, booking calendar, in-app
calling, etc. will definitely give a raise to your budget.

Above, was just a basic analysis of the factors that might affect the cost of
development. To determine the pricing of the application, an estimated
development cost will be calculated with the approximate time required for
creating each feature. The development time is calculated in hours and the rate
per hour varies from company to company. Each company has its own rate per hour.
I am considering an average price of development per hour $30, based on
worldwide standards. Now let’s assume we are building an app solely for iOS
platform.

#### 1. The Team

A minimum team will include:

* 1 UI designer
* 1 iOS developer
* 1 back-end developer
* 1 project manager
* 1 Quality Assurance Engineer

**The app architecture**

Next, we determine the app architecture. Every project commences with initial
action steps. We can calculate the hours per step by diving the app into
different components based on the overall app resources, modules and technical
base used.

* 20 hours — Project setup
* 20–25 hours — REST API implementation
* 10 hours — Database model
* 10 -15 hours — Implementation of services and libraries

**Development effort estimation**

**Registration/login feature** — The basic step is registration so that the user
will be able to access the app. To start using the app, it would be seeking the
agreement of the user with the conditions and policies besides the other
fundamental details. This would consume around 10 to 12 hours.

#### 2. User Profile

The user profiles will be of two kinds, guest and host (owner of the place).
Both have to create their profiles by filling in their personal details like-

* Name
* Gender
* E-mail address
* Birth date
* Telephone number
* Permanent living address
* Personal description

#### 3. Filters

The listings and search filters can be used by hosts as well as users. A host
can add information on the house type, room type, accommodation details, photos,
pricing, etc. if user is looking for a place to stay in, they will require
details about housing like location, check in and check out dates, house type,
and size, amenities, host language, photos of the home, price range, etc. as
this feature is vast, developers can take up to 24 hours to build it.

#### 4. Accommodation Description

After the filtered have been chosen, a wide variety of search results will pop
with various options and description of the rooms you wish to stay in. The
variants are as follows-

* Photos
* Map with the location
* Accommodation
* Host Profile
* Amenities offered or available
* Rating
* Reviews
* Price
* Terms and conditions
* Available dates

#### 5. Maps

Maps allow the users to freely search for a perfect location, check various
spots on the maps, and spot a place to stay. Map localization helps to see the
routes, neighborhoods, and amenities in proximity to the location. All these
help in choosing the desired place to stay in.

#### 6. Settings

The users can customize and configure their preference under this feature. The
settings menu allows you to control the following functions-

* Push notifications
* SMS notifications
* Updates on rental options in a specific area
* Conversation with the host(messages)
* Wish-lists
* Payment method and currency

#### 7. Invite Friends

A user can easily invite a friend to download the application and join it.

#### 8. Add to Favorites

This is a fundamental feature by which the user can bookmark certain results and
add them to favorites and view them later.

#### 9. Translate Feature

This feature helps the user to translate the description of the rooms into their
preferred language. It is enabled through the Google translator, the text is
sent to google translator and translated into the chosen language.

#### 10. Guide Feature

This personalized feature shows the sites and neighborhoods around the chosen
location. It shows the locations around that can be visited.

#### 11. Property Listing

Once you sign up as a host, you need to fill in all the required details, the
app will show you the approximate rent you can charge for your
house/apartment/room.

#### 12. Back end

The server-side part of the app is very crucial as the product requires time to
configuration from both client and server side. The client side is how it will
virtually interact with a user and the server side includes its functionalities,
server connections, etc. the back end is the most time-consuming part of the
entire process.

### So, what’s our grand total?

After having dealt with all features and modules, we have reached an estimate of
the development cost. each a total cost of $28140 — $30840. Which is
approximately $29000 — $31000 considering the $30 per hour as the average rate
for counting the cost. However, this can vary depending on the mobile app
development company and the technology they use. Moreover, the hourly rates
differ from country to country.

After looking at all the aspects and stages of development, we may say building
an app is not an easy and swift task. However, if all the things are lined up in
a proper manner, not only will it be super successful but also very affordable.
